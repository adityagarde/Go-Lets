### 1. Go Fundamentals

- Go is a **compiled** language - which means the go code is directly converted into machine code that the processor can execute.
- On the other hand, for interpreted languages like JavaScript, code is read line by line and a different program, i.e. the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
- Because of this compiled languages like Go tend to be faster than Interpreted languages.

<br>

- Almost everything is a `Type` in Go.
- Although Go has types and methods and *allows* an object-oriented style of programming, there is no type hierarchy.

- Running a program & HELP commands - 
```go
go run main.go

go help <command>

go env GOPATH
```
